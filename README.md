## Background
This is a project for the UC Berkeley MIDS capstone course. The problem we are solving is recommending restaurants for two users going on a date based on their preferences.

## Overview
This is a HTML/CSS/JS web application that is built with bootstrap, jquery, and a flask backend server. The server takes frontend user input as input into  recommendation models implemented on the server, which return recommendations to be displayed to the user.
